Market Scanner v1 (Locked Scope)

What this implements:
- Fixed universe (Top 100 S&P + major ETFs)
- 2-minute scan cadence (cron-ready)
- Deterministic strategy evaluation
- Explainable signal output
- Firebase persistence (signals only)

What this does NOT do:
- No trading
- No options execution
- No automation toggles

This is the foundation layer.
